# 🏆 Code Olympics — Ultimate Scrapper (Judge Assist Tool for Code Olympics)

A futuristic, web scrapper & analyser tool designed to help **Code Olympics judges** automatically evaluate submitted projects — analyzing line counts, loops, functions, and structural depth — all under **400 lines** with **no imports**.

---

## ⚡ About The Project

**Code Olympics — Ultimate Scapper** was created to support the **judging process** of the Code Olympics challenge.  
During evaluations, judges often need to review dozens of repositories and verify if teams respected key constraints such as the line limit, coding structure, and logic density.  
This tool automates that process — instantly analyzing code or GitHub repositories in a single, glowing interface.
